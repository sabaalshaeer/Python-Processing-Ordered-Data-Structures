# Python-Processing-Ordered-Data-Structures
Write code to get input from the user and print the individual words the user entered.

Position the insertion point in line 5.

Write the code as shown.

Line 5 stores input from the user in a variable named user_input.
Line 6 uses the split() statement to split the input text wherever any spaces appear. Each item in the resulting list will be a single word.
Line 7 prints the list.
Run the program and test some input.

Run the program.

In the console, when prompted to provide words, type This is a test sentence and press Enter.

Verify that Python prints a list and that each item in the list is a string of a single word.

Prompt the user for more input to add to the existing list.

Position the insertion point at the end of line 6 and press Enter.

Write three new lines of code as shown, and revise the print statement to output added_results.

Line 7 prompts the user to provide more words. Assign the input to the variable user_input2
Line 8 uses the split( ) function to create another list of words.
Line 9 uses the + operator to combine the two lists.
Line 10 now prints out the combined lists.
Test the list addition.

Run the program.

Enter This is a test sentence for the first input and These are more words to test for the second input.

Verify that your output list (added_results) combines the items from both lists.


Append and remove individual items to and from the list.

Position the insertion point at the end of line 10 and press Enter twice so that your insertion point is on a new blank line 12.

Write six new lines of code as shown.


Line 12 prompts the user for a word to append, storing the word in append_input.
Line 13 appends the word in append_input to the added_results list.
Line 14 prints the list up to this point.
Line 15 prompts the user for a word to remove, storing the word in remove_input.
Line 16 removes the word in remove_input from the added_results list.
Line 17 prints the completed list.
Test out your append and remove operations.

Run the program.

Enter This is a test sentence for the first input and These are more words to test for the second input.

When asked to append a word, enter input

Verify that your word was added to the list in the printed statement.

At the next prompt, type in test to provide a word that currently exists in the list.

Verify that the first instance of the word test was removed from the list.

In the Run window, close the wordcount tab.

The word "test" still exists in the list. Why has it not been removed? Click here for answer.
